Chemical Reaction

Overview
Lyrics
Way too busy to wanna be in love
Don't have the time for something so frivolous
What's pulling me to you, baby, I don't know
Chalk it up to those funny pheromones
You came along, you came on strong
Shaking my equilibrium
When it feels so right, when it feels so good
It's automatic (ooh-ooh), I just gotta have it (huh-uh)
Is it just moonlight? Is it just that look?
All this attraction (ooh-ooh), just let it happen (huh-uh)
When it's so hmm-mm, and it's so huh-uh
Baby, you call that a chemical reaction
When it's so hmm-mm, and it's so huh-uh
Baby, you call that a chemical reaction
My heart's saying abandon all the facts
My head's telling me leave 'em where they're at
I like to have it all looking logical
What's happening is out of my control
Then you came, you came along
Now it's all delirium
When it feels so right, when it feels so good
It's automatic (ooh-ooh), I just gotta have it (huh-uh)
Is it just moonlight? Is it just that look?
All this attraction (ooh-ooh), just let it happen (huh-uh)
When it's so hmm-mm, and it's so huh-uh
Baby, you call that a chemical reaction
When it's so hmm-mm, and it's so huh-uh
Baby, you call that a chemical reaction
When it feels so right, when it feels so good
It's automatic (ooh-ooh), I just gotta have it (huh-uh)
Is it just moonlight? Is it just that look?
All this attraction (ooh-ooh), just let it happen (huh-uh)
When it's so hmm-mm, and it's so huh-uh
Baby, you call that a chemical reaction
When it's so hmm-mm, and it's so huh-uh
Baby, you call that a chemical reaction
Chemicals
A science so involuntary
Lose control
Don't need to think it over, baby
